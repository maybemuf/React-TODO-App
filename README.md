# **My first React app.**
### It's a simple todo app that helps managing with your tasks and makes you more productive. *At least i hope it is :)*
Main features:
  * Create/remove task.
  * Fillter completed and active tasks.
  * Responsive/crossbrowser.

And there is something im working on:
  * DragAndDrop to reorder the task list.
  * Set time to complete the task, if u didn't complete its by the time you set, mark as failed.
  * And some other cool stuff!!
